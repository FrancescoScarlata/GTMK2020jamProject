  - '4500 D.C

    Houston, we lost control of a drone in an hostile land far from
    the base.'
  - We can only see it from the top and you can switch the weapons we equipped to
    make it safe.
  - 'With the weird gravity in that place, maybe not everythin is lost.

    We need
    help to bring it back to the planet base. '
  - 'Every weapon has different recoils and different effects

    There also might
    be aliens along the way, and we don''t like each other.'
  - Good luck
